I have always wanted to create an application. Unfortunately, I was not lucky with programming teachers - even in a special IT technical college. So, my career and interests have moved towards UI/UX design.
Now I want to expand my abilities for a back-end programming. Which will give me a great ability to create applications from idea to publication.

The Motorola Academy is a great opportunity to learn programming. Because it is intense, hard and highly professional and practical. It sounds like a real challenge and adventure!

I also want to learn to programming  because it is easiest for programmers to find a job or be relocated to work in the USA.
This is my target. Someday sooner or later I will get it.
I know it is a long and hard way, but the most fairest one too, because it depends only on my hard work.
